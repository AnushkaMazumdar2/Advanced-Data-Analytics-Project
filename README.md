# Why Staying Home Might Be the Best Choice: A Crime Prediction Saga

Over the past few years, we have seen tremendous growth in crimes, and along with that, the brutality in those crimes. With the recent case of RG Kar Medical College, Kolkata making headlines. For those of you who are unaware about the case, a PG 2nd year doctor was brutally raped and murdered at around 4 am in the college seminar hall, while she was resting after her 36 hours duty! Many such cases in the past have occured, and many still continue to occur.
India has unfortunately become the hub of crimes. According to the most recent government report on crimes in the nation, India recorded 31,677 occurrences of rape in 2021 - an average of 86 cases per day - while roughly 49 cases of violence against women were reported every hour. As per the 'Crime in India 2021' report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there were 28,046 occurrences of rape in 2020 compared to 32,033 in 2019. The Ministry of Home Affairs oversees the NCRB's operations.
Here I will focus on how badly the meteropolitan cities of India have been crime-ridden. Predicting crime rates is a complex challenge that requires a deep understanding of data, algorithms, and the ability to present insights in an accessible format. In this blog, I'll take you through the process of how I built a crime prediction website, from manually creating a dataset to deploying the final model on a custom-built website.
